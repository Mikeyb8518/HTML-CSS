<p>The start of The Ramen Restaurant has always been a dream I wanted to achieve since I was a young boy.<br>
My passion for cooking, started when I was a young. My family was always busy with my father always<br>
working and my mother at home to make sure myself and the house was taken care of. But no matter what<br>
my father always made sure that he was home on time to sit down and have dinner with us. My mother would<br> 
make his favorite dish and that was her ramen recipe that was passed down to her from her mother. This bowl<br>
of ramen would make my fathers hardest days at the office appear as if it never happened and the joy he would<br>
have taking each bite was always so fascinating. With me being the only child and always at the house with my<br>
mother, I finally worked the courage to tell her that I wanted to learn the family recipe.</p>
<p>After learning my mothers Ramen Recipe, my passion for cooking was made after learning that. From that moment<br>
I wanted to bring that happiness to everyone, like my mother would do to my father. So after I finished going to<br>
cooking school I made it my goal to find a place where I can open a restaurant and bring my mothers family recipe<br>
to others who just want to enjoy ramen and my other various dishes served at The Ramen Restaurant. I intended to only use
my mothers recipe for the ramen and treat my staff as well as customers like they are family. Being an only child I
know the importance of family and that is why The Ramen Restaurant takes that very serious. I hope to not only bring you
happiness from the food served but to also bring happiness into your life like food and cooking has done for me.</p></div>

<p>The Ramen Restaurant is a peoples choice who enjoy very flavorful food as well as a great atmosphere.<br>
We take great pride in our restaurant as this represents a piece of my family and bringing it right in<br> 
front of you. Our family restaurant encourages you to bring your whole family and enjoy all the various<br>
dishes we prepare daily. My chefs and staff take great pride in making sure the service is one that you will
always remember, rather that be from the food or our great service to make it seem you as well are apart of the
family. I often go around to the customers and introduce myself as I feel it is important as a owner to interact
with customers and hear all the feedback. The Ramen Restaurant only uses the best ingedients as my mother took great pride
in that as well. I hope to see you enter The Ramen Restaurant and hear your feedback so please stop by.</p></div>
