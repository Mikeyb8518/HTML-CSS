  rice noodles made daily and a meat of your choice served with a nice portion of vegetables. This brings the delectable dish many people would usually travel out of the country
  for right in front of you with the best service attached to it as well.</div>

  <div class="desc">The picture above is a dish we decided to mix two favorite dishes into one. Here is the Broccoli and Beef soup, this soup is a chefs favorite.
  Instead of your traditional Broccoli and Beef that is just servered on a plate, our chefs decided to make there own verison and make it a soup 
that lets the broccoli and beef soak in our family recipe broth and adds much more flavor to a traditional dish.</div>
