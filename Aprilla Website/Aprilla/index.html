        <h2>About The RS660</h2>
        <p><div class="specs">The 660-cc twin-cylinder 100-horsepower engine offers exhilarating acceleration<br> 
        and impressive torque, much of it even at low revs. An exceptionally harmonious<br> 
        engine delivers the performance of a much larger twin-cylinder, but it is so compact<br> 
        and lightweight that Aprilia's engineers can encase it in an agile, hardworking<br> 
        chassis that is suitable for both the road and the track.</div></p>
        <p><div class="specs">The RS 660 high-quality riding experience owes much to technological features such<br> 
        as the colour TFT display with special graphics and APRC settings for complete control<br> 
        over riding parameters at all times. The ability to choose between 2 predefined and 3<br> 
        customisable riding modes depending on the track or road conditions takes the enjoyment<br> 
        factor up another level. </div></p>
